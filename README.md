# Squawker

This small application helps by creating a squawk code for aviation purposes. By clicking on the button it will create the 4-digit number.

The application does not require any internet connection (as of now). However this can change in the future if I decide to add some features that require an internet connection.

## Installation
Move to the release page and download the latest release version. Extract the archive into an folder of your own choice. 

## Compiling
Download the source code and open it in Visual Studio. Compile the code and run the application.
There's no specific method or requirement to compile the code.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add checks for known multiplayer platform if squawk code is already in use.
- [ ] Add keybind to automatically generate a squawk code.
- [ ] Add some settings to customize keybind or choosing the preferred multiplayer platform.

## Suggestions
Even if its a small basic application I am open to suggestions. If you have any suggestions or ideas feel free to open an issue.
